Encapulation: hide data implementation; flexibility

Constructor:
1. Constructor is a special method that has same name as the clas name and does not have nay return type
2. It is used to create an object of the class and initialized the class members.
3. f there's no  constructor in the class, c# compiler will provide a default constructor and it parameters
4. Constructor can be overloaded which means method cna have the same name but difference parameter
5. Constrcutoer cannot be inheried. so a constructor cannot be overriden.
6. byu default a dervied class constructor will make a call to a base class constructor.

Inheritance: allows one class to inherit from another existing class so that the derviced class can reuse, extend 
the code from base class.
In c#, we have single inheritance. 

Employee Management System
Full time employee: biweekly pay, benefits
Part time employee: hourly pay, 
In common: id, name, phone, email, address; perform work

Abstract class: means we can not create any instance out of this class; it can contain both abstract and concrete method.

if you want to override the method in the derived class, the method in the base class has to be either abstact class or vitrual class

A sealed class is a class that cannot have any child classes.

polymorphism: many forms

1. Method Overriding:happens between base class and derived class, we have same method signature including the 
ex modifier, method name and input/output params ; and we will give different implementationfor the smae method

2. Method OverLoading: happens in the same class; they have smae method name, access moifiers but they may have different input/output parameters.
